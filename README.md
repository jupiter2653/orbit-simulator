# Orbit simulator
Python programm using the 2nd law of Newton to simulate in real time gravitational interactions between two or more celestial bodies with a decicated UI. This program is our work for our informatic class final project.
## Operating process
For each frame, the system compute the position of each object in the next frame considering a movement vector to which the variation of the speed vector has been added considering the following formulas : <br>
